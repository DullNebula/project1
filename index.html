    <p>Hello, visitor!</p>
    <p>Glad you're here! I'll be using this to tell you a bit about myself as well as show finished projects I'm working on.</p>

    <p><strong>How did I get into programming?</strong></p>
    <article><p>I first got started with programming some time in high school. 
    Although my first experience was with C# for use within Unity, a video game engine.
But with the difficulties that in that time I wasn't able to get into it. But
I always wanted to learn more, whether for video game development or another avenue
that could lead me into how programming worked. </p></article>

        <p><strong>A couple of my hobbies and interests</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Video games</strong></li>
    <p>Video games have been a large part of my life ever since I was young.
        The types of stories and interactive elements that are created were a blast
        for me to experience. So it shouldn't come as a big surprise that I would want
        to try and develop my own some time to bring those same experiences to others.
    <br>

    </p>
    <li><strong>History</strong></li>
        <p>There's something about learning history that always caught my interest.
        Whether its the lesser known facts from the world wars to more recent events and
        all the way back to the victorian era, I'll want to learn about it. A more specific
        type of history I love is also that of armored vehicles and how they developed
        over the past hundred years. (first tank was made and used in 1914!) There are many
        strange and quirky designs that most people have never seen or heard of.

    <li><strong>Art</strong></li>
        <p>This is a more recent hobby I've been trying to pick up. It hasn't gone
            further than a few practice drawings every once in a while but I'm hoping
            to make it more consistent soon.
        </p>
    <li><strong>Cooking</strong></li>
        <p>This is also something I've been getting more into. There's something
            satisfying about home made meals and there's plenty of recipes out There
            to try out.
